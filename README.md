# DRAArrayDesign
Dielectric Resonance Antenna Array Design

Details of the project and the implementation is given in DesignProject.pdf

To briefly give the idea about the project. The abstract is metioned below.

Abstract: (Taken from DesignProject.pdf)

Aim of this project was to compare the 4x4 non-tapered array with a 6x6 amplitude tapered array and analyze the
difference between SLL, gain and EIRP for tapered and non-tapered configurations. Array unit cell was a DRA with
center frequency 6.5 GHz, it was designed using Antenna Magus. CST was used to design antenna arrays. Matlab
was employed to generate the array definition file. Effects of steering the beam were also analyzed. It was found
that, the gain is slightly changed when moving from non-tapered to tapered. EIRP and SLL change significantly.
Steering plays an important role in gain and directivity computation and it is affected by the number of elements in
the array.
